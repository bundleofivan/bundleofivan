Welcome to my GitHub. I'm currently a Full-Stack Software Engineer at The PokÃ©mon Company International, an avid runner (sometimes...), and an aspiring chef. 

I'm interested in creating accessible, clean, and intuitive UI.

On the side, I'm learning parallel computing with Rust and the joys of data warehousing.
