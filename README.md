### Oh hi there! 👋

[![Linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Ivan%20Lim-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white&link=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivangeeaunlim/)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivangeeaunlim/)

I'm currently a Full-Stack Software Engineer at The Pokémon Company International ⚡, an avid runner 🏃 (sometimes...), and an aspiring chef 👨‍🍳. 

I'm interested in 
- creating clean, accessible, and intuitive UI
- scaling services globally in real time
- blending the real and virtual world through AR technology

On the side, I'm learning parallel computing with Rust and the joys of data warehousing.

My predominant languages are Javascript/Typescript and Python.
